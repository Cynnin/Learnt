                        Sims Stories #24 - Tina's Party

                            Tina's a flurry of movements, hopping from one room to the next, checking and double checking.
                            Everything had to be perfect. She side-steps Frankie and Mama Kitty, who seem intent on causing
                            as much trouble as was physically possible. Mama is sick again - old age, maybe? Berry had promised
                            to take the cats to the vet, but now she looks up from her semi-permanent spot on the couch and grinned
                            at Tina.
                           <p> "Relax", she drawls, propping her feet on the table. "It's not like she's going to die. Right?"</p>
                           <p>Tina frowns. "Are you going to be of any help? At all?"</p>
                            <p>"Nope"</p>
                            <p>"Just checking"</p>
                            <p>
                                Berry lifts herself off
