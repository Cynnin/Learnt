                            Tina's a flurry of movements, hopping from one room to the next, checking and double checking.
                            Everything had to be perfect. She side-steps Frankie and Mama Kitty, who seem intent on causing
                            as much trouble as was physically possible. Mama is sick again - old age, maybe? Berry had promised
                            to take the cats to the vet, but now she looks up from her semi-permanent spot on the couch and grinned
                            at Tina.
                           <p> "Relax", she drawls, propping her feet on the table. "It's not like she's going to die. Right?"</p>
                           <p>Tina frowns. "Are you going to be of any help? At all?"</p>
                            <p>"Nope"</p>

                            It has been 5 months since I started on chapter 21. God! I have gone nowhere at all since then,
                            and I've only grown busier. My book was beside me the entire day, and I did not write one word.
                            I have to step over other books' focus-time to see if I can force out an ending before I grow old.
                            My progress is disturbingly slow with all my works-in-progress, but seeing as this is my main novel,
                            this is especially serious. At the very least, I'm almost at the end of the chapter, which is when I
                            usually have the most problems on a chapter. Thank God for small things, sha.

                            So, I'm late to the party. Obviously. The Black Adam movie, starring Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson
                            has been out for a good minute. But never fear - I too am here to give my unnecessary opinions
                            on the semi-death knell of the now defunct DCEU. <br>
                             First, I'll admit that I heard a lot of talk. Talk that led to my mistaken belief that I would 
                             be watching an unmitigated disaster akin to Batman vs Superman or the first Suicide Squad film.
                             Alas, I was to be disappointed. Black Adam is a painfully mediocre film and ego project featuring 
                             actors way too good for it (Pierce Brosnan was wasted on this film)

                        I'm back, and I bring gifts! Today, my gift to you is a review of the film
                        'Joint Ventures', a deliciously bad yoruba film with an equally hilarious poster.
                        I, of course, discovered this gem on Amazon Prime - the ultimate rival of Netflix
                        when it comes to terrible movies. And I had thoughts. A lot of them. And you, lucky
                        reader, get to hear all of them.<br>
                        Where to even begin? The film starts with a soundtrack that seems like it came before 
                        my father's time. And my dad is older than Nigeria - at least the official age of Nigeria.
                        The film then cuts to a birthday party, the dullest I've ever seen onscreen or in real life

                        It is currently day ?? since I started the Experiments page (I should have kept a record, my bad),
                        and I have been trucking along. Not without its complications - I have a semi-permanent headache and my 
                        eyes feel as though they've been in some kind of battle, but I've made a lot of progress. I hope I 
                        have, anyway. Still working on my second task, and wondering is my ability to read has gone offline, 
                        because I have been making a home page when I was supposed to make a blog POST. Regrets abound, but I'm
                        going ahead with it because I've put so much work in already. I'll just link one of these posts and make 
                        a full page from that.
